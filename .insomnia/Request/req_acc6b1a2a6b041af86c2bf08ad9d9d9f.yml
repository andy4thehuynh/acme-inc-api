  Deletes a single [CatalogObject](#type-catalogobject) based on the
  provided ID and returns the set of successfully deleted IDs in the response.
  Deletion is a cascading event such that all children of the targeted object
  are also deleted. For example, deleting a [CatalogItem](#type-catalogitem)
  will also delete all of its
  [CatalogItemVariation](#type-catalogitemvariation) children.
