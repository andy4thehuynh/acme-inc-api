description: |-
  Deletes a set of [CatalogItem](#type-catalogitem)s based on the
  provided list of target IDs and returns a set of successfully deleted IDs in
  the response. Deletion is a cascading event such that all children of the
  targeted object are also deleted. For example, deleting a CatalogItem will
  also delete all of its [CatalogItemVariation](#type-catalogitemvariation)
  children.

  `BatchDeleteCatalogObjects` succeeds even if only a portion of the targeted
  IDs can be deleted. The response will only include IDs that were
  actually deleted.
